## Next version

Doc strings are now wrapped in a DocString type rather than being raw
strings. The TokenFmt output is now slightly different as a result.
Added FmtToken::Link as well.

## Rink 0.8.0

`gpl` feature has been renamed to `bundle-files`.

`rink_core::DATES_FILE` and `rink_core::CURRENCY_FILE` are now `Option`s
and are only Some if `bundle-files` is set, otherwise they are None,
just like `DEFAULT_FILE`.

The intention is for distro packages to install these files to the
filesystem (e.g. in `/usr/share/rink/`) instead of embedding them in the
executable. See [PACKAGING.md](../PACKAGING.md) for more info.

### Behavior

- Unrecognized directives in definitions.units now print an error
  instead of being silently ignored.
- Categories for non-units are now ignored. This may be improved in the
  future, but will require changing categories to be namespaced.
- The output has changed slightly, as numbers can be represented as
  recurring digits now.

## Rink 0.7.0

### Behavior

- Quantities are now in a separate namespace from normal units.

### Changes

- `Dimensionality` changed from an alias of BTreeMap to its own struct.
- Several fields of `Context` were moved to the `loader::Registry`
  object stored as a field on it.
  - Also moved `lookup_exact` and `lookup_with_prefix` there.
  - `dimensions` field renamed to `base_units`.
  - `reverse` field renamed to `decomposition_units`.
  - `canonicalizations` field renamed to `base_unit_long_names`.
- `Def::Prefix` and `Def::SPrefix` have been merged to an `is_long` bool
  on `Def::Prefix`. `SPrefix` is `is_long == true`.
- `Def::Dimension` and `Def::Canonicalization` were merged to create
  `Def::BaseUnit`.

### Removals

- `Context::short_output`
- `factorize::fast_decompose`
- `search::search`
