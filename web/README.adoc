= Rink web

This is the sources required to build https://rinkcalc.app, which is
a statically generated site.

== Requirements

* `wasm-pack` (`pacman -S wasm-pack` or cargo install)
* `cmark-gfm` (`pacman -S cmark-gfm`)
* https://soupault.app/install/[soupault]
* Node.JS (21.7.1 known to work)

== Instructions

1. Run `wasm-pack build --target web rink-js`. This only needs to be
   re-run after making changes to rust code.
2. Enter `web/repl/` and run `npm install`
3. Enter `web/` and run `npm install`
4. Enter `web/` and run `soupault --verbose`
5. To view, enter `web/build/` and run `python -m http.server -b localhost 3000`

Github releases are only fetched once. To re-fetch them, delete
`web/build/releases.json` and re-run soupault.

== Deployment

Copy the contents of `web/build/` to your server.
